# VisuDocs

A collaborative, real-time code editor with support for multi-user editing. Similar to Google Docs, VisuDocs is a code editor that uses websockets to support multiple users working on the same code. Also supports features such as saving code, chat, and user authentication.

# Tech Stack

Frontend was built with React and TailwindCSS. Backend was built using Express, Node.js, and Socket.io for the multi-user functionality. 

Since all users in a room work with the same dataset, Redis is used for temporary data storage, ensuring that new users joining a coding session can quickly retrieve the existing state. Code data is periodically saved to MongoDB under the host userâ€™s account and reloaded when a project is initially opened.

Redux was used in conjuction with MongoDB for auth, along with Firebase to enable sign in with Google. 

Uses the [monaco editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) for the code editor and the Piston API to execute the code.

# Usage

```git clone``` the repository and install the dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/pnotato/VisuDocs
cd VisuDocs
npm i
```

You will need to create a ```.env``` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
MONGODB_KEY=<a mongodb url>
JWT = <any string, will be used for json web token signing>
VITE_FIREBASE_KEY=<firebase api key>
```
Start the frontend by running ```npm run dev``` and backend with ```node server.js```. The app should start running on [http://localhost:5173/editor](http://localhost:5173/editor)

# Notes

Looking to deploy the app soon, and update the documentation so there's more than just text!
